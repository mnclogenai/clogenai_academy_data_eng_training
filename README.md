## Training Program Overview

This comprehensive training program covers modern data pipeline engineering using Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and the Medallion Architecture. Students will learn to build scalable, reliable data pipelines from ingestion to analytics-ready datasets.

### Key Technologies Covered
- **Apache Spark & PySpark** - Distributed data processing
- **Delta Lake** - ACID transactions and data versioning
- **Medallion Architecture** - Bronze, Silver, Gold data layers
- **Databricks** - Unified analytics platform
- **ETL/ELT Patterns** - Modern data transformation approaches

### Learning Path
1. **Week 1**: Foundations of data pipeline engineering
2. **Week 2**: Data ingestion strategies and storage patterns
3. **Week 3**: Data cleaning, transformation, and quality management

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Review the weekly session notes in order
3. Practice with the provided code examples
4. Complete hands-on exercises using the sample datasets

## Prerequisites
