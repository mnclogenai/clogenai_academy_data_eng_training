# Capstone Project Kickoff
**Date:** January 25, 2026  
**Focus:** Engineering Discipline & Lead Time to Value

---

## 🎯 Session Objectives

1. **Understand the Capstone SDLC:** Scaling from a notebook to a production-grade pipeline.
2. **Professional Requirements & Design:** Defining scope, architecture, and trade-offs.
3. **Version Control Strategy:** Establishing a daily commit cadence and branching model.
4. **Testing & Automation:** Implementing validation frameworks and repeatable workflows.
5. **Documentation & Delivery:** Professional READMEs and walkthrough readiness.

## 🏗️ 1. Project Assignment: Data Pipeline Engineering Capstone
The Capstone Project is a culmination of your 11-week journey. You will build a production-grade, end-to-end data platform using the Medallion Architecture on Databricks, focusing on **Engineering Discipline** rather than just code.

**Technical Focus Areas:**
- **Requirements:** Clear problem statements and design justifications.
- **Data Engineering:** CDC, Bronze/Silver/Gold layers, and AI enrichment.
- **Reliability:** Data quality (GX), schema enforcement, and automation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Refer to the full [Project Specification](week12-13_project_specification.md) for technical requirements.

## 📦 2. Deliverables & Timeline
The project is assessed across five SDLC disciplines over two weeks:

### Phase 1: Planning & Implementation (Week 12)
- **Requirements & Design:** Problem definition and architecture diagrams.
- **Initial Implementation:** Bronze and Silver ingestion pipelines.
- **Version Control:** Daily commits starting from day one.
- **Milestone:** Initial project assessment call.

### Phase 2: Automation & Documentation (Week 13)
- **Advanced Features:** AI Integration and performance tuning.
- **Testing & Automation:** Full validation framework and CI/CD-like automation.
- **Documentation:** Final README, technical summary, and demo readiness.
- **Milestone:** Final project demo and technical sign-off.

---

## 🤖 3. AI-Assisted Engineering
Leverage AI to improve your **engineering discipline**, not just to write code:

- **Antigravity (IDE):** Use for structured refactoring and ensuring modular code patterns.
- **Documentation:** Use LLMs to help articulate *why* you made specific design choices in your README.
- **Testing:** Generate unit tests and validation cases using AI assistants.

---

## ⚙️ 4. Version Control: Your Living History
Your Git repository counts for **75 score** of your total. 

- **Commits:** Small, frequent, and descriptive. Avoid "Initial commit" or "Final version".
- **Daily Cadence:** Daily commits are expected as evidence of engineering progress.
- **Professionalism:** Treat your project repo as a portfolio piece showing your iteration process.

---

## 📅 5. Assessment & Review Schedule
**Time Window:** 7:30 AM – 8:30 AM IST (Daily)

### Stage 1: Design Review & Assessment
- **Dates:** Jan 27th – Feb 1st
- **Focus:** Requirements, Design, and Ingestion strategy.
- **Action:** Schedule a 1:1 review call with mentors for scope validation.

### Stage 2: Final Demo & Score Review
- **Dates:** Feb 3rd – Feb 7th
- **Focus:** Implementation, Automation, and Documentation quality.
- **Action:** Live technical walkthrough and final scoring.

## 📈 6. Scoring Guidance (SDLC-Based)
Evaluation is based on the **Final Project Scoring Matrix (500 Total Score)**:

| Discipline Area | Max Score | Key Indicators |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Requirements & Design** | 100 | Clear problem, diagrams, design justifications. |
| **Implementation Quality** | 150 | Modular code, error handling, AI enrichment, CDC. |
| **Version Control** | 75 | Meaningful commit history, iterative development. |
| **Testing & Automation** | 100 | Validation framework (GX), orchestrated workflows. |
| **Documentation** | 75 | Professional README, setup guide, clear summary. |

> [!TIP]
> Strong projects show **Engineering Discipline** (how you built it), not just functional code.
